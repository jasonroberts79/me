# Quirks
* Like many engineers, my first instict on hearing a problem is to imagine a solution
* I like to play devil's advocate, this derives from wanting to understand the whole picture
* I'm an introvert, thus I'm not always forthcoming with my opinion, but I will always give it when asked. 
* I sometimes pause to think long enough to make it awkward

# I love discussion
Exchanging ideas on topics is very engaging and rewarding for me. I believe that there's value in recognizing everyone's thoughts and opinions. The process of exploring ideas makes new connections in the brain for all the participants involved, as long as they're engaged. To that end, <b>psychological safety</b> is very important to me. I want people to feel comfortable being open and expressing themselves at any time. So if I do anything that makes you feel uncomfortable, please raise it with me in private, no matter how minor.

# I care deeply about software engineering
Creating software that people want to use and delivering value to the customer is what drives me. I believe this is done by the disciplined practice of writing well structured, understandable, testable, and maintainable code. I believe we enable this by following the core values and principals of the Agile Manifesto. 
* <b>Individuals and interactions</b> over processes and tools
* <b>Working software</b> over comprehensive documentation
* <b>Customer collaboration</b> over contract negotiation
* <b>Responding to change</b> over following a plan
* https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html

To that end, <b>communication, collaboration, adaptability, and retrospection</b> are key practices to hold in our job as software engineers
